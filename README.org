SQLite Bindings for Coalton

This is a WIP, suggestions and contributions are welcome.

This system is arranged into 5 packages, increasing in abstraction:
1. `coalton-sqlite/ffi`
   CFFI calls, a slightly modified version of the package in [[https://github.com/TeMPOraL/cl-sqlite][cl-sqlite]]
2. `coalton-sqlite/sqlite`
   Simple Coalton wrapper around the above FFI
3. `coalton-sqlite/value`
   A DynamicValue type that covers any SQLite value, as well as a
   SQLiteValue typeclass for binding/reading
4. `coalton-sqlite/query`
   A few high-level query functions, they deal with ~(List DynamicValue)~
5. `coalton-sqlite/record`
   A ~define-record~ macro along with functions for
   inserting/selecting record types

The query and record packages are probably going to change since I am
not super happy with them right now.

#+begin_src lisp :package coalton-sqlite
  (coalton
   (with-database ""
     (fn (db)
       (execute db "create table person (name, age);"
                mempty)
       (execute db "insert into person values (?, ?)"
                (make-list (Text "garlic0x1") (Int 26)))
       (execute db "insert into person values (?, ?)"
                (make-list (Text "foo") (Int -2)))
       (query db "select * from person" mempty))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src lisp
: ((#.(TEXT "foo") #.(INT -2)) (#.(TEXT "garlic0x1") #.(INT 26)))
#+end_src

There is an API for Coalton-defined tables but I would not recommend using it
unless you are very brave.

#+begin_src lisp :package coalton-sqlite
  (coalton-toplevel
    (define-table Point
      (x I64)
      (y SqliteValue)))

  (coalton 
   (with-database ""
     (fn (db)
       (create-table db Point)
       (insert db (Point 1 (Int 2)))
       (insert db (Point 1 (Text "foo")))
       (the (List Point) (select-all db)))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src
: (#.(POINT 1 #.(TEXT "foo")) #.(POINT 1 #.(INT 2)))
#+end_src
